                <h1> Our Present:  </h1>
                    <p> Shot. Murdered. Deported. Underpaid. Ignored. These are the realites minorities face on a daily basis.
                        It seems like everyday there is a headline about an African-American being shot and killed by a police officer
                        , children being separated from their parents, Migrant workers barely making a livable wage, individuals recording
                        themselves getting discriminated at stores. More so, these civil issues have been going on for far too long, and
                        no one is trying to help. These issues have been persistent in our history and government officials have ignored them 
                        for years. Minorities are tired of it.  
                    </p>

                <h2> Our Objective:  </h2>
                    <p> Our mission is to change history. Our goal is that by creating this website, those who have been neglected and ignored 
                        can share their story and be heard. Within the more people share their story the stronger voice we will create. This page
                        is dedicated to the ignored, murdered, and seperated individuals because they are the ones who build up America. We see you,
                        because this is America.
                    </p>
                  
                <h4> Our Background: </h4> 

                    <p> 
                        &#8287 &#8287 &#8287 &#8287 &#8287 My parents came to the United States almost 20 years ago. They migrated from a small ranch 
                        in Durango to the United States. My dad's life in Mexico was tough. He had to work ever since he was 
                        a child. He went to school and finished high school, but didn't have the opportunity of a good education.
                        Finishing school in a ranch is not a big deal and won't get you a high paying job. In addition, there is no 
                        sort of college in a small ranch. He would have had to study out of town and it was too expensive.
                        His routine consisted of getting out of school and then go to work. Which included taking care of the 
                        animals and working at a store making furniture. He worked non-stop and coming home at night after
                        work, he then did his homework. Although, he was always occupied by his jobs, he was an outstanding 
                        student. My dad had a hard life in Mexico. In school the teachers were violent and would hit him. At work
                        he had to carry bags of cement, bricks, wood, and more. It was an exhausting job.
                    </br>
                        &#8287 &#8287 &#8287 &#8287 &#8287 While my mom was the youngest out of 8 kids in her family, there was only three females, and five males.
                        Therefore, having very few females in the family, and the two older sisters not being very helpful. My mom 
                        was always busy helping my grandma with all the chores, cooking, and more. Majority of her older brothers migrated
                        around 15 years old to the Unites States since they were such a big family, and it was difficult to buy the needs.
                        So she also helped my grandpa with the animals in the ranch. She only finished elementary school to stay home and help.
                        My mom had various responsibilites. When my mom and dad began dating and formalized their relationship with marriage, a lot
                        of things changed. They wanted to begin a family. But within all the problems there was and lack of opportunities to succeed. 
                        They decided to come to the United States to offer their family a better future. 
                    </br>
                        &#8287 &#8287 &#8287 &#8287 &#8287 They came the United States with absolutely nothing. They had no money, no clothes besides what they had on, no food,
                        no knowledge over the language or culture of the United States. The most terrifying thing was being in a new place, far 
                        from home with no family and no where to stay. They faced discrimination from many individuals, have been neglected
                        many opportunities simply for being hispanic. Yet, my parents managed to work hard and get to where they are now. 
                        My parents got a job, a house, a vehicle, and most importantly, were able to offer my sisters and I great school and
                        job opportunities. I truly am thankful for all that they have sacrificed to be here and what they have done to keep moving forward.

                        &#8287 &#8287 &#8287 &#8287 &#8287 I grew up in Zacatecas, Mexico with my 16 other siblings. My father died when I was eight, so my mother was
                        left to tend to 17 kids. I had to give up school when I left sixth grade because my mother could not afford it.
                        I knew that this life was not meant for my future kids, I wanted more for them so I decided from then on, I would 
                        leave and give them something more.
                    </br>
                        &#8287 &#8287 &#8287 &#8287 &#8287 I left my ranch in Zacatecas for two reasons, my future kids and the danger. I was running away from a
                        controlling man that would kill me if I would not marry him. I left so I can be free from his danger and so that my kid would not have to
                        live in the poverty I did. There was eighteen people in my home, a home of only two rooms.
                    </br>
                        &#8287 &#8287 &#8287 &#8287 &#8287 I directly dealt with discrimination when my husband was deported to Mexico when my youngest was only
                        a year old. I had three kids to raise, so I worked multiple jobs. My jobs would treat me like I did not know anything, only how to clean
                        and cook. I was given no breaks at my job; I was told to finish and leave. I am fair skinned, so many people do not automatically assume
                        I do not speak English. Once they discover I cannot speak it well, I am treated like a child and not an adult. People are different around
                        me the moment they find out I am Mexican, and I wish that would change. Not just for me, but for everyone who is in my shoes.
