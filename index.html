                <h1> Our Present:  </h1>
                    <p> Shot. Murdered. Deported. Underpaid. Ignored. These are the realites minorities face on a daily basis.
                        It seems like everyday there is a headline about an African-American being shot and killed by a police officer
                        , children being separated from their parents, Migrant workers barely making a livable wage, individuals recording
                        themselves getting discriminated at stores. More so, these civil issues have been going on for far too long, and
                        no one is trying to help. These issues have been persistent in our history and government officials have ignored them 
                        for years. Minorities are tired of it.  
                    </p>

                <h2> Our Objective:  </h2>
                    <p> Our mission is to change history. Our goal is that by creating this website, those who have been neglected and ignored 
                        can share their story and be heard. Within the more people share their story the stronger voice we will create. This page
                        is dedicated to the ignored, murdered, and seperated individuals because they are the ones who build up America. We see you,
                        because this is America.
                    </p>
